Worked on a 6-person team to make a 2D plotter. 
I mainly worked on the design side of the project and made the rough model in Inventor. Later a more realistic model was made in Solidworks to take advantage of it's toolbox. We modeled all parts such that they could be made from acrylic and cut out using a laser cutter.
