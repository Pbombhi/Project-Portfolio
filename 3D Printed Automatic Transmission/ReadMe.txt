I wanted to learn how an automatic transmission worked so I downloaded some files off Thingiverse to get a hands on part that I could use.
To print these parts I used FDM, SLA, and SLS printers, hence why the gears have different surface finishes. 
Over the years the pins, which I printed using a SLA machine, have broken and some parts such as the output shaft and the carrier have been lost.
